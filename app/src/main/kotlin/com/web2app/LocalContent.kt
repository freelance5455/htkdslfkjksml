 * `https://appassets.androidplatform.net/web/` rather than as a `file://` URL. The
 * origin is what makes the difference: under `file://` the browser blocks ES modules,
 * `fetch()` and the storage APIs outright, so a site that works everywhere else would
 * look broken inside the app — and would not match what the builder previewed, which
